Today: I spent a long time redoing ex 3.20-21 on the Mobile web course. I was stuck because I didn't follow the right order of things, so it didn't work even though my code was right. It had been a long time since I last worked on this...It's not easy for me to learn with videos, I integrate more things if I can read texts.  But I really want to finish this course.

Then I practiced with Flexbox zombies, learned about one-offs and how to deal with them (align-self).

Then more pair-programming with Hannah. We finished her series of callbacks exercises!
