title: Service workers in Microsoft Edge!
date: 2017-12-22

I haven't worked this last few days because I'm done with a nasty sinusitis. I was exhausted with the pain and the infection and couldn't do anything. Yesterday I couldn't take it anymore and I went to the doctor. Turns out I needed antibiotics and couldn't fight it on my own.
I'm relieved from the pain now but still very tired. Nevertheless I think I will be able to codetomorrow.

I'm still keeping an eye on programming news. And there's something pretty exciting concerning service workers: Micorsoft Edge will enable them!

More on this [here](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/12/19/service-workers-going-beyond-page/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3BQ5Nd9VohS3OuZmXT95g4ug%3D%3D)!
