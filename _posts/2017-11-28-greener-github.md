I want to have greener github stats. I figured out the best way to do it was to commit something first thing in the morning. So here I am!

I'm using the terminal to do all this. I'm really a beginner at some things. Here: I need to remember that one creates a new file with "touch".

I also have to look how to delete a file, because I made a mistake before creating this file... gotta use "rm".
