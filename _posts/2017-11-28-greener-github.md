I want to have greener github stats. I figured out the best way to do it was to commit something first thing in the morning. So here I am!

I'm using the terminal to do all this. I'm really a beginner at some things. Here: I need to remember that one creates a new file with "touch".

I also have to look how to delete a file, because I made a mistake before creating this file... gotta use "rm".

A bit of CSS: started working on my nephew's site.

Then I worked with @hanapotski on callbacks and higher functions. We're trying to solve a challenge that looks like FCC' "sorted union", but we want to return the values that are common to all the arrays passed as arguments. (The function is defined with one argument only, though)
