I have finished the Offline First course! So what's left now is only the ES 6 updates (4 mini courses).

## Template Literals

I've learnt what those backticks are. They are for *template literals*. (basically what I did with those silly madlib examples 2 days ago.)
And what I did is called [string interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation)

One of the improvements with template literals is you don't need those bothersome newline characters ( \n ).

What you do instead:

          const name = 'Aurelie';
          const country = 'France';

          const message = `Hello,

          My name is ${name}.

          I live in ${country}.`;

          console.log(message);
          
  output:
  
> Hello,
>
> My name is Aurelie.
>
> I live in France.

## Destructuring

This is totally new to me. 

This is something you do with arrays and objects.

### destructuring arrays

    const positions = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];
    const [first, second, third] = positions;
    console.log(third); //fish

    const days = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
    const [monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday] = days;
    console.log(tuesday); //2
