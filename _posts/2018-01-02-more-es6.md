title: More ES6
date: 2018-01-02

I have finished the Offline First course! So what's left now is only the ES 6 updates (4 mini courses).

I've learnt what those backticks are. They are for *template literals*. (basically what I did with those silly madlib examples 2 days ago.)
And what I did is called [string interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation)

One of the improvements with template literals is you don't need those bothersome newline characters ( \n ).

What you do instead:

          const name = 'Aurelie';
          const country = 'France';

          const message = `Hello,

          My name is ${name}.

          I live in ${country}.`;

          console.log(message);
          
  output:
  
> Hello,
>
> My name is Aurelie.
>
> I live in France.
