### Playing with animation
These past few days I've been ill again but I kept on coding! And I finished the lesson on javascript syntax. Yesterday was reviewing time, and today it was more recreational.

I've started studying ProcessingJS which a javascript library specialised in drawing and animating. I learned about this library because I've started taking math classes on Khan Academy!!! :D
And they have computer science classes, the first one of which being a javascript-based introduction to programming. The commands seemed a little bit odd, so I researched what it was exactly. 

Actually, it uses ProcessingJs, so I researched it and started to follow the ProcessingJS tutorial to start my first animation ever on codepen. 
(It's very basic for now, just a square and an ellipse guided by the mouse, each having a different speed)

The tutorial is [here](http://processingjs.org/learning/):

I'm tweaking it on codepen to understand what each part does. 

I had to reasearch something I've never used before: 

### How do you get the viewport dimension with javascript?

Answer is [here](https://andylangton.co.uk/blog/development/get-viewportwindow-size-width-and-height-javascript)

Remember:

    var yourWidth = window.innerWidth;
    var yourHeight = window.innerHeight;
    
(OF COURSE, there are exception to this depending on the browser, but the page I've referenced cover this. However, the code shown above will work in most cases.)

### Miscellaneous

Also, I came accros [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/) which is a catalog of libraries. 

A library I want to try soon: [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/blob/master/README.md) (or : [this site](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/))
