Today, I finished the Chuck Norris challenge on Codingame. 

I didn't use a new method I could write on today, and even though I solved 100% of the challenge, I have mixed feelings with my performance. I'm proud I did it, but after reviewing the best solutions, I saw that there were methods, and actually higher-order functions I could have used. I knew all the methods&HOF involved. I just didn't think to use them! I mostly used for loops and if statements, which results in a lengthy solutions.

I guess this is a normal stage in the learning process, but it should be temporary. So I'm planning to review the solutions to each of the challenges I've solved there (and should do it also for the free code camp's challenges.) Then, when I solve new challenges, I should consider whether I could replace what I plan to do with a HOF. I'm kind of familiar with .filter() because I struggled when I learned about it, but today I totally forgot about .reduce() and .map().
