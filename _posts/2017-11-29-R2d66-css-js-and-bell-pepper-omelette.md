So today on the menu was pair-programming again, all the way from Reims, France, to Los Angeles, USA. And I had a pepper bell omelette. 

I practices css on my nephew's site and on this github page, Hannah helped me with a css reset on Adrien's site, and I have arrived to a satisfying result on my github page (for now...:))

Next step on Adrien's site is to add a navbar. I don't want to use bootstrap because I want to learn how to do the collapsing (and all the responsive stuff) by myself this time.

Then we practiced more exercices on callbacks and we finished the one we began lest night. As it was very similar to "Symmetric Difference", we moved over to FreeCodeCamp and tada!!!! we solved it too. So now I can push it on my github algorithms repo.

Good night, sleep tight, and have fun coding dreams!
