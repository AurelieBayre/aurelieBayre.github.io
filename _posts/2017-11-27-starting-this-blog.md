# Starting this blog

## Resolution
Okay, so my resolution for December is to log my progress here as well as on Twitter...on a daily basis!
Preferably using the terminal, for practice.

## Yesterday 
Yesterday I learned a bit of Flexbox, using [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/p/flexbox-zombies)!!! lots of fun. Finished a Git tuto. 

## Today (Day 64):
* completed chapter 2 of Flexbox Zombies
* practiced css on this very site.
